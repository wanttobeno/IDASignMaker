Sigmake takes pattern files as the input and creates a signature file.
It can take several pattern files at once.
Usage:

	sigmake [-sw] pattern-file(s) sig-file

where
	switches (-sw) may be kept in indirect file '@file'
	(one switch per line)

input pattern files are file1+file2+file3...
wildcard input file names are allowed too.
the default extension of the input files is .PAT
the default extension of the output file is .SIG
The name of the output file should be no more than 8 symbols for compatibility.

collision resolving
-------------------
Sigmake looks for and takes as the input file <outfile>.exc (<outfile> is name of
output signature file). This file contains a list of excluded function names
and other directives for sigmake. EXC file is a text file. Sigmake will
automatically create an EXC file if it doesn't exist. It an EXC file exists, sigmake
will append information to it.

If sigmake creates an EXC file, then you must edit it and re-run sigmake.

NOTE: although sigmake uses all information from pat files, it doesn't
write everything into sig file. Some information during this process
is lost and therefore the process is not reversible.

Decription of switches
----------------------

	-x...  name of file with excluded function names exc错误文件名字 这里默认就行
	       default is <outfile>.exc

	-c     Check presence of ctype directive. If this switch is specified, 侦测c类型写入sig
	       the input pattern files  must be prepared with -c switch of
	       parselib.

	-d...  debugging output file (default: <outfile>.err)  处理过程的错误提示信息存入的文件 用于调试
	       This file contains dump of output signature file.

	-n...  signature file title for IDA. 指定一下sig文件在ida中显示的库信息
	       If not specified, "Unnamed sample library" is taken by default.
	       This title will appear in the window of signatures in IDA.


	-D...  name is data name, not code name 不建议用 指定一些符号名字 ida遇到他们不会转换为指令 启动签名用
	       Not recommended to use, because the same effect may be achieved
	       by the directive in EXC file.

	-a...  application types the signature may be applied to. 启动签名的时候指定目标类型 
	       Combination of bits. When in doubt, set a bit.
	       (list of bits can be displayed by -ha switch)

               GUI version of IDA does not use this information
	       TXT version: The signature file will appear in the abridged list of
	       signatures if bit is set.

	-o...  os types the signature may be applied to.启动签名用 os类型
	       Combination of bits. When in doubt, set a bit.
	       (list of bits can be displayed by -ho switch)

	       signatures if bit is set.

	-f...  file format types the signature may be applied to.启动签名用 目标文件类型
	       Combination of bits. When in doubt, set a bit.

               GUI version of IDA does not use this information
	       TXT version: The signature file will appear in the abridged list of
	       signatures if bit is set.

	-p...  processor id 启动签名 表示处理器架构
	       (list of ids can be displayed by -hp switch or taken
                from idp.hpp in IDA SDK)
               GUI version of IDA does not use processor ids
	       TXT version: the signature file will appear in the abridged list of
	       signatures if the id is set correctly.
	       Default is 0 (IBM PC).

	-s     make startup signature.表示生成的sig是启动签名 和普通区别是 不能把目标位置的某个函数从地址替换为符号 因为刚开始反汇编 哪里来的特征码
	       This switch must be specified for startup signatures.
	       Sigmake produces slightly different signature file if this
	       switch is specified. For example, references to functions can't
	       be used in startup signatures because a startup signature is
	       applied at the start of disassembling and no function names
	       are present yet.

	-t...  minimal length of normal function. if function is smaller 不知道啥意思
	       then a fixup reference is generated. default: 16(decimal)

	-h#    help (#:a-apptype,o-ostype,f-formats,p-processor)帮助文件

        -r     do not use fixup information when trying to tell similar patterns apart.找到两个特征码相同的sig字符 不使用存在的信息 来区别他们 

        -L     to specify the length of patterns in the .pat file (default: 32 bytes).特征码长度 默认32字节

        -l...  use -l<r|i><pattern> to tell sigmake what to do with some 遇到sig相同的 不匹配 或者直接阻止匹配
               functions/labels when it encounters them.
               -lr<pattern>: reject functions matching the pattern
               -li<pattern>: ignore functions matching the pattern, when
                             searching for duplicate entries from the
                             .pat files.

        -X     to dump extended information about collisions, in the .exc file. 遇到问题 生成exc文件 相信信息 每一矛盾行下面都是这行sig的各种信息 比如crc值 特征码 函数长度等等



Format of EXC file
------------------

EXC file is a text file.
Lines starting with a semicolon are comment lines.
Sigmake stops reading EXC file when it encounters a line starting with

;------

and will append information from that file position. Since this line
is generated each time sigmake creates an EXC file, don't forget to
remove them. Otherwise sigmake will ignore your modifications in the
EXC file.
Sigmake automatically creates EXC file if it is not present.
It starts EXC file with the following lines:

;--------- (delete these lines to allow sigmake to read this file)
; add '+' at the start of a line to select a module
; add '-' if you are not sure about the selection
; do nothing if you want to exclude all modules

EXC file contains names of functions to be excluded from the signature file.
Sigmake writes names in groups. Each group represents one or more collisions.
Each module is represented with one line, for example:

_remove                                           	00 0000 558BEC1EB441C55604CD211F720433C0EB0450E8....5DC3................
_unlink                                           	00 0000 558BEC1EB441C55604CD211F720433C0EB0450E8....5DC3................

At the start of the line there are function names. The rest of the line contains
information about the module (checksums, pattern and other) needed to
distinguish one module from another with the same name).
Your task is to insert '+' or '-' sign at the start of the lines to resolve
collisions.
+ means that you are sure about your selection,
- means that the name will appear as a comment in IDA.

For example, if we decide to exclude _remove from the signature and leave
_unlink, then we insert a '+' sign:

_remove                                           	00 0000 558BEC1EB441C55604CD211F720433C0EB0450E8....5DC3................
+_unlink                                           	00 0000 558BEC1EB441C55604CD211F720433C0EB0450E8....5DC3................


This way we order to exclude the _remove() function and keep the _unlink() function in the
signature.


Two directives may appear in the EXC file:

 DATA=name

note that the first character is a space character - this is common to all
directives in the EXC file. This directive means
that the specified name is a data name, not code name and IDA will not
convert bytes at this name to an instruction.

 LIBNAME=library name

has the same meaning as -n switch: specifies the name of the signature file which appears
in the window of signatures.
